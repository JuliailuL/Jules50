# in Python yu don't need the type of variable and no semicolon. Just as in C = is not equality bus assignment

# instead of: int counter = 1;
counter = 0

# incrementing the variable by one:
counter = counter + 1

# this will also increment the varaible by one:
counter += 1

# in python there is no ++ oder --
